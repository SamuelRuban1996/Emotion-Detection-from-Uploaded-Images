# Emotion Detection from Uploaded Images

This project aims to detect emotions from uploaded images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model developed with TensorFlow. The application predicts real-time emotions from images and is deployed with a Streamlit interface for user interaction. An ethical analysis is also provided, discussing user privacy concerns and bias mitigation strategies in emotion detection technology.

## Project Overview

Emotion detection technology uses deep learning to recognize human emotions based on facial expressions. This project addresses the following:
1. Training a CNN model for emotion classification.
2. Deploying a web interface using Streamlit for users to upload images and get emotion predictions.
3. Analyzing ethical implications related to privacy and biases in emotion detection.

## Setup

### Requirements

This project requires Python 3.7 or later. Required libraries are listed in the `requirements.txt` file and can be installed via `pip`.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/emotion-detection-from-images.git
    cd emotion-detection-from-images
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies for Streamlit and TensorFlow.

## Usage

### Running the Streamlit App

1. To run the Streamlit app, navigate to the project directory and use the following command:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2. This will open a browser window where you can upload images for real-time emotion prediction.

## File Structure

- **app.py**: Streamlit app script that loads the model and provides a UI for users to upload images for emotion prediction.
- **emotion_detection_model.py**: Contains the CNN model architecture and training pipeline.
- **ethical_analysis.docx**: Word document discussing ethical implications, user privacy, and bias mitigation in emotion detection.
- **README.md**: Project overview and setup instructions.
- **requirements.txt**: List of dependencies required to run the project.

## Ethical Analysis

An ethical analysis on emotion detection technology has been included, covering:
- **User Privacy**: Ensuring images are processed securely without unauthorized access.
- **Bias Mitigation**: Reducing potential biases in emotion detection by training the model on diverse datasets to avoid demographic skew.

For more details, refer to `ethical_analysis.docx`.
